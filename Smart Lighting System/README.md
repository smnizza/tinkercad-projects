# Smart Lighting System

This project simulates a smart lighting system using Arduino Uno in Tinkercad. The system automatically controls the light based on ambient light levels and motion detection.

## How It Works  
- The ambient light sensor detects the surrounding light level.  
- The PIR sensor detects motion.  
- The light turns ON if:
  - The ambient light is low.
  - Motion is detected.
- The light turns OFF if:
  - The ambient light is sufficient.
  - No motion is detected.
- The light status is displayed on the LCD screen.

## Folder Structure
