# Arduino Serial Communication

This project demonstrates serial communication between two Arduino boards in Tinkercad. A transmitter (slave) sends button state data to a receiver (master), which controls an LED accordingly.

## How It Works  
- The **transmitter (slave)** reads the button state.
  - If the button is pressed, it sends a signal to the receiver.
- The **receiver (master)** receives the signal and controls the LED.
  - If the button state is HIGH (pressed), the LED turns ON.
  - If the button state is LOW (released), the LED turns OFF.

## Folder Structure
