# Smart Pressure-Based Door Mat

This project simulates a smart pressure-based door mat using Arduino Uno in Tinkercad. The system detects foot pressure and motion to trigger an alarm.

## How It Works  
- The force sensor detects pressure on the mat.
  - If pressure is detected, the system registers a **Step Detected** event.
- The PIR sensor detects motion.
  - If motion is detected, the system registers a **Motion Detected** event.
- If both pressure and motion are detected simultaneously:
  - **Alarm Triggered** state is activated.
  - The LED turns ON.
  - The buzzer sounds an alarm.
