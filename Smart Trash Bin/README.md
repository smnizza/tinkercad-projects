# Smart Trash Bin

This project simulates a smart trash bin using Arduino Uno in Tinkercad. The bin opens automatically when an object is detected within a certain distance.

## How It Works  
- The ultrasonic sensor detects objects within 20 cm.  
- If an object is detected, the servo motor opens the bin lid.  
- The red LED turns ON as an indicator.  
- The buzzer sounds to signal the bin is open.  

## Folder Structure  
- **`trash_bin.csv`** â†’ List of components used in the project.
- **`trash_bin.ino`** â†’ Arduino code for the project.  
- **`trash_bin.pdf`** â†’ Schematic design in PDF format.  
- **`trash_bin.png`** â†’ Circuit diagram as an image.
