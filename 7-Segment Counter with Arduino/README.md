# Traffic Light Simulation with Arduino (Tinkercad)

This project simulates a traffic light system using Arduino Uno in Tinkercad. It includes a pedestrian crossing mechanism activated by a push button.

## Components  
- 1 Ã— Arduino Uno R3  
- 2 Ã— Push Buttons  
- 2 Ã— 300Î© Resistors  
- 2 Ã— Anode 7-Segment Displays

## How It Works  
- When **Push Button 1** is pressed, the counter increments from `01` to `99`.  
- When **Push Button 2** is pressed, the counter decrements from `99` to `01`.

## Folder Structure  
- **`tcounter.ino`** â†’ Arduino code for the project.
- **`counter.pdf`** â†’ Schematic design in PDF format.
- **`counter.png`** â†’ Circuit diagram as an image.
