# Keypad-Based Door Lock System with Arduino (Tinkercad)

This project implements a simple security system using an Arduino Uno, a 4x4 keypad, an LCD display, and a servo motor for door control.

## Components  
- 1 Ã— Arduino Uno R3  
- 1 Ã— Positional Micro Servo  
- 1 Ã— Piezo Buzzer  
- 1 Ã— PCF8574-based 16x2 LCD (I2C, address 0x20)  
- 1 Ã— 100Î© Resistor  
- 1 Ã— 4x4 Keypad  
- 1 Ã— Red LED  
- 1 Ã— Green LED  
- 2 Ã— 220Î© Resistors  

## How It Works  
- The user sets a **PIN** using the keypad, which is displayed on the **LCD screen**.  
- To unlock the door, the user must re-enter the correct PIN.  
- If the entered PIN is incorrect, the **red LED** turns ON, and the user must try again.  
- If the PIN is correct, the **green LED** turns ON, and the **servo motor** unlocks the door.

## Folder Structure  
- **`door_lock.ino`** â†’ Arduino code for the project.  
- **`door_lock.pdf`** â†’ Schematic design in PDF format.  
- **`door_lock.png`** â†’ Circuit diagram as an image.  

## Usage  
1. Open the Arduino IDE.  
2. Upload the provided code to an Arduino Uno.  
3. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.  
4. Run the simulation in Tinkercad or test it on a real Arduino setup.
