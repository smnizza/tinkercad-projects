# 7-Segment Counter with Arduino

This project implements a simple counter using Arduino Uno and a 7-segment display in Tinkercad. The counter increases or decreases based on button presses.

## Components  
- 1 Ã— Arduino Uno R3  
- 2 Ã— Push Buttons  
- 2 Ã— 300Î© Resistors  
- 2 Ã— Anode 7-Segment Displays

## How It Works  
- When **Push Button 1** is pressed, the counter increments from `01` to `99`.  
- When **Push Button 2** is pressed, the counter decrements from `99` to `01`.

## Folder Structure  
- **`ccounter.ino`** â†’ Arduino code for the project.
- **`counter.pdf`** â†’ Schematic design in PDF format.
- **`counter.png`** â†’ Circuit diagram as an image.
