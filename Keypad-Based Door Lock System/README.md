# Keypad-Based Door Lock System

This project implements a simple security system using an Arduino Uno, a 4x4 keypad, an LCD display, and a servo motor for door control.

## Components  
- 1 Ã— Arduino Uno R3  
- 1 Ã— Positional Micro Servo  
- 1 Ã— Piezo Buzzer  
- 1 Ã— PCF8574-based 16x2 LCD (I2C, address 0x20)  
- 1 Ã— 100Î© Resistor  
- 1 Ã— 4x4 Keypad  
- 1 Ã— Red LED  
- 1 Ã— Green LED  
- 2 Ã— 220Î© Resistors  

## How It Works  
- The user sets a **PIN** using the keypad, which is displayed on the **LCD screen**.  
- To unlock the door, the user must re-enter the correct PIN.  
- If the entered PIN is incorrect, the **red LED** turns ON, and the user must try again.  
- If the PIN is correct, the **green LED** turns ON, and the **servo motor** unlocks the door.
