# Pedestrian-Friendly Traffic Light

This project simulates a traffic light system using Arduino Uno in Tinkercad. It includes a pedestrian crossing mechanism activated by a push button.

## Components  
- 1 Ã— Arduino Uno R3  
- 1 Ã— Push Button  
- 2 Ã— Red LEDs  
- 1 Ã— Yellow LED  
- 2 Ã— Green LEDs  
- 5 Ã— 220Î© Resistors  
- 1 Ã— 1kÎ© Resistor  

## How It Works  
- The traffic light consists of three LEDs for vehicles (red, yellow, green) and two LEDs for pedestrians (red, green).  
- When the green light for vehicles is ON, they are allowed to pass, while the pedestrian red light remains ON.  
- If a pedestrian presses the button, the pedestrian light turns green, and the vehicle light turns red.  
- The yellow light is used for transition between red and green for vehicles.
